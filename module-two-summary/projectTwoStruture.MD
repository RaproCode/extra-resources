How to start your module two project:

Start with wireframes! Drawing what you want your app to look like helps when creating the models that make up the basic structure of your app. This helps when you think about what hbs files you'll need to create. The design does not need to be finished. Stick to your initial project idea- don't change mid week.

List all the features you need. Mark the important ones, and do them first. If you have time you can add other features later. Spend time creating your models at the start and name things carefully- changing the names later is harder because you use the names in so many different places (routes, forms etc)

When planning, divding up the tasks between you. Someone can take care of one route while someone else works on another. Or you can create one model each- it's up to you how you split the work. Make sure you talk to each other about what you're doing! Communication is very important.

Plan your models! You need one for your users and the second model is up to you. Will you have admins? Will they have to upload a picture when they sign up? Will there be default values? What is going to be required?

Use Irongenerate to set up your app.

Create different folders to help keep your code organised. Then create extra files - one for each model, plan your routes and split them into different files, think about how many hbs files you're going to need and how you can split them.

Add comments to your code. This is going to be important because you'll be sharing the code with your team. Every time you add, or change something, test the feature and then push to github. It's important to give your commits good messages because this will help you find what you are looking for later and shows your team what you have added/changed.

It's better to finish one feature before moving onto another- this includes adding basic styling. Doing css always takes longer than you expect so it's better to start adding it from the start
